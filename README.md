# Background  

 
Goto Grocery (GotoGro) Inc have requested a proposal to develop a software application for them. Goto Grocery is based in Hawthorn that provides quality grocery items for their members.   

Goto Grocery uses a paper-based system to record their member details and their member sales records. The current system has proven to be difficult to keep track of their members grocery needs. As a result, unnecessary items are being purchased that the members do not need.   

Goto Grocery would like an efficient application that records their members’ details their members' sales and able to see an insight into each of their members grocery needs.  
  
# Scope  

The GotoGro-MRM project aims to transition Goto Grocery Inc. from its traditional paper-based system to a digital Members Record Management System. This system will streamline the management of member details and their grocery preferences, allowing for more informed inventory decisions. The program will have a graphical user interface for the client to add, remove or edit member records and sales records. The interface will be a web application that allows for the input of data which is then sent to a database to be stored. It must also have the ability to export information from the database to a file in a CSV format to allow for further analysis by Goto Grocery. 

# Key Objectives  

1. Member Management: The system will provide functionalities to add, edit, search for, and delete member records.  

2. Sales Record Management: Staff will be able to add, edit, and delete sales records associated with members.  

3. Reporting: The software will generate individual member reports and an overall sales report, both of which can be exported in CSV format.  

4. User Interface: A graphical user interface will be developed to ensure ease of use for staff.  

5. Feedback Mechanism: Members can provide feedback, further enhancing the store's understanding of their needs.
