# SWE20001 Semester 2 2023 - Managing Software Project
# GotoGro-MRM

> [!NOTE]
> Please follow the installation guides for BackEnd



# Front End

# Back End


## The project requires:
- [Node JS 18.17.1](https://nodejs.org/en)

## Dependencies Installation guide

> [!Important]
 > Remember to install dependencies (node_modules) INSIDE <root>/BackEnd/..
1. Moving into /BackEnd/ subfolder -> ```cd BackEnd/```
2. Run this ```npm i``` for installing dependencies
3. Then you could run our BackEnd locally with -> ```npm run dev```


## (Optional) - Running localhost database:
> [!NOTE]
> I will push our backend into Cloud services soon so you don't have to do this. Feel free to test on your local machine if you like.

> [!Warning]
> Modify the credentials that fit your PC: - (Sorry haven't merged all into .env, so you have to manually modify)
  ``` /BackEnd/config/ ```
- [XAMP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
  > Just need to enable MySQL
- Database GUI - any! [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or [MySQLWorkBench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) is fine
- Run this -> ```npx sequelize-cli db:migrate``` to build database schema automatically
  > I already wrote the scripts, check ```/BackEnd/migrations```
